## Main Focii of the Week:
- QNLP research updates
  - Sprint:
  - Discussion of codebase version 4- end-to-end pipeline for Uspantekan baseline model
 	  - Fix 1: Code switched from `numpy` to `pytorch`, needed to switch from arrays to tensors
  	- Ansatz- issues fixed by changing ansatz type
  	- Parser language settings changed to account for spanish embeddings, for next version of codebase
  - Big picture focus- end-to-end model for Uspantekan and Spanish
  - Notes for meeting with Robert Henderson- grant application plan
  	- Spanish:
   		- without embeddings, with 100 sentences, classification accuracy is 71%. Very tunable
   		- Next plan: see what classification accuracy we get with embeddings
    - Uspantekan
     	- Uspantekan data, no embeddings
     	- Classification accuracy: 72%
  - Next steps:
  	- see what classification accuracy we get with Spanish embeddings, to see if embeddings can improve scores. This will help us rely on non-English text
   	- Tuning
    	- Get F1 scores to assess all quadrants of the testing
    	- Assess with quantum computing is able to get us closer to underspecificity.
   - Plan for NSF grant application, procuring more data, and adding flexibility to add more low-resource langauges  
- Workshop
  - Run through for session 1, and facilitating GenAI session in Carlos's absence
  - Went through Austin's updates on Zoom metrics, and double-checked registrations 
- Readings
  - Carlifornia's new AI bill
  - "Mission:Impossible langauges" for NLP reading group
- Mandatory EDGE learning sessions:
  - Active shooter training
  - HIPAA training  

## Meetings
- Stand up with Carlos
- GA meeting
- QNLP meeting with Robert
- QNLP sprint
- Discussion with Jeff Post-workshop video upload plan, Cyverse issues with permissions for uploads (resolved)
