## Main Focii of the Week:
- QNLP research updates
  - Revisited khatri et al., to examine if our code is carrying out all the same steps
Worked on a flow-chart to illustrate the training procedure
  - Khatri et al. used 4 models (3 trained in task, 1 pretrained). Documented what each model was doing
  - Cleanup of github repo to archive older versions of the code, updated master branch by removing all code
- Testing code
  -  Worked on documentation for python library poetry, used to set up requirements for a given codebase
  - How to save a dataset as hd5 and pkl train-test-dev split, and how to look inside the tensors thus created to examine the components. 
  - Revisited pytorch dataloaders.
- Workshops
  - Examined multiple examples for semantic search, and implementing them on Colab- tested ease adn runtime
    - Pinecone, Cohere, Distilbert
  - Set up an LLM for semantic search with Ollama on my system and on google colab (very buggy)  
- Research: How is semantic search connected to language models and embeddings?

## Meetings
- QNLP sprints
- Weekly checkin with Carlos
- DSI +Cyverse meeting
