## Main Focii of the Week:
- Prep for QNLP Meeting
  - Language model and data in place, stuck on a bug- that reads a null item into Numpy
  - Debugging by looking at the language trees generated by lambeq, to check if the language model reading the Spanish data is working correctly
    - are there too many OOV words?
    - ToDo for Mithun- take a look at the issue
-  Completed NLP workshop descriptions, updated github repo with a table of contents
  -  All items for the workshops reviewed by Carlos, going ahead with initial code and content for the Wiki
  -  Also met with Brenda to discuss workshop plan, and solicit input
  -  ToDo: check with Enrique to avoid overlapping topics, and get feedback
