## Meetings
- QNLP work sprints on Wednesday and Friday
  - Updated Jira with new tasks and updates
  - Examined issues received outlook calendar invites 
  - Discussion on results of baseline meeting
    - Can qnlp + uspantekan- straight out of the box give a good classification accuracy?
        - update: NO
        - Rather after tuning max accuracy on dev was 72%...which was given by cups and stairs model
    - Options
        - path 1: go back to spanish- and load with embeddings.
        - path 2: try with discocat/bobcar parser + uspantekan.. last time we tried, got errors.
  - Megh's updates:
      - Set up repo for code, as well as a folder with dataset in rhenderson's repo:
      - QNLP dtaset: https://github.com/bkeej/usp_qnlp/tree/main/qnlp-data
      - QNLP code repo: https://github.com/ua-datalab/QNLP/blob/main/Project-Plan.md
  - Todo for Megh
      - Run the code for Spanish- we will need embeddings
      - Use fasttex- Used by GPT for building ngrams and aligned work vectors.
      - Look at the Thesis code from Mithunâ€™s contact (Khatri et al.)
        - Run this code directly and see what happens
  - How to access shared analyses on Cyverse- Mithus shares his setup so we have access to GPUs
  - Go to https://de.cyverse.org/analyses/ and switch the dropdown menu to "shared with me"
  - Choose the relevant analysis.
  - Setup and tech issues
    - Get permission to run analysis with a GPU on cyverse. Talk to Michele about permissions
    - Set CPU to 8GB
- LLM Extraction meeting
