  - Megh- HF has a lot of models trained by illegally/unethically obtained data that is very tough to directly identify. Social media companies have also started suing researchers for unethical data use since 2023. So any workshop that goes beyond toy models and learning will need additional instructions for how to use the right kind of content from HuggingFace for research that one intends to publish
