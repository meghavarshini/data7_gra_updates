## Main Focii of the Week:
- RNN research for Brenda's consultation: Can RNNsâ€™ ability to train on sequences and order be used for image classification?
  - simple answer: no
  - ran a quick literature review, sent links to relevant papers
- Prep for meeting with Enrique
  - Main issue: fixing a for loop for automatically reading paper text from th json file to the LLM, with more checks and balances
- Research for NLP workshop series
  - finalized topics, confirmed with Carlos
  - ACL and ICML paper round up: looked for potential code+papers for the workshop series
