### Main Focii of the Week:
- Continued with ['Deep Learning Fundamentals with Sebastian Rashka'](https://github.com/~_fundamentals), Units 4 and 5:
    - Working with Lightning
    - How to use Dataloaders
    - What is `__init__` and `__main__`?
    - How to identify data bottlenecks
    - One hot encoding
- Running Jupyter via ssh (thanks Brenda!)
    - [Github tutorial](https://github.com/bhuppenthal/data_lab_logs/blob/main/ssh_tunneling.md)
### Major Bottlenecks:
    - [Done] Installing and running >1 Python version
    - [Done] Setting up a new Conda environment, Jupyter kernel for Python 3.9
    - [Done] Updating Conda build on system to call multiple environments
    - [ToDo]- find out why Jupyter kernel with Python 3.9 keeps dying when set up with ` python3.9 -m jupyter lab`
    - Why don't Watermark and Lightening run with Jupyter notebook?
