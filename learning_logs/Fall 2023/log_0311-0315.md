## Main Focii of the Week:
- Researched RNN basics and carlosâ€™s notes for upcoming workshop
- Updates from Mithun- QNLP meeting
  - 1998 Lambeks paper on math===language:here
  - 2020 bob coecke QNLP
  - Type grammar revisited: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48975-4_1

  - Neural networks use stochastic gradient descent- a top down approach. Language needs a bottom up approach
  - Category theory hierarchy- everything is a category.
  - Lambek- The Mathematics of Sentence Structure
  - Language is a bag of things, with 3 things- noun, sentence, NP. Anything can be created from these three
  - Type Grammar revisited (Lambek 1999): groups and proto groups- when an operation is done on members of a group, it remains in the same group?
  - Combinatory Categorical Grammar
  - Qubit- every time a decision is made, multiple options are collapsed into one. Until a decision is made, all possibilities are true. A qubit hangs out in infinite space, until it is acted upon by an operator.
-   Quantum model for NLP Coecke: one grammatical category acting on a word, to move it one way or another
- Dependency parsing looks like matrix multiplication
- Bag of words: sentences split into smaller meaning carrying chunks (words), which can be interchangeably combined in different ways
    - However- word combination is governed by semantic relationships between words
- Lambeq- `pip install lambeq to install`
- If we know the minima of the gradient descent- can we build language up from it?
- TODO- install lambeq and feed it a sentence [done on Cyverse]
- Run end to end- work on it like a tutorial
- Think- tokenizer available for English, Spanish, but not other languages. How do we work without one?
- Run this on Spanish first
- Think of a problem
- Jupyter notebook stored at: /data-store/iplant/home/mkrishnaswamy/qnlp
