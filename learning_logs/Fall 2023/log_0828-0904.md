### Main Focus of the Week:
- Continued with ['Deep Learning Fundamentals with Sebastian
Rashka'](https://github.com/meghavarshini/deep_learning_fundamentals), Units 3
and 4.
    - Working with Data Loaders
    - Setting up a feed forward model with one layer
- Set up [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cq9_SipCVP6hIJWxPT3Hgf_hnUGpQ7iWtLCBcbVFeW4/edit?usp=sharing) for adding notes on general ML and DS related reading
- Investigated major installation issue with Anaconda- why did anaconda by
default install incompatible versions of pytorch and torch vision, instead of
the correct versions?
    - `UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be incompatible with the existing python installation in your environment:
Specifications: 
  alabaster -> python[version='>=2.7,<2.8.0a0|>=3.6,<3.7.0a0|>=3.7,<3.8.0a0|>=3.5,<3.6.0a0']
  appdirs -> python[version='>=2.7,<2.8.0a0|>=3.5,<3.6.0a0|>=3.6,<3.7.0a0|>=3.7,<3.8.0a0']
  argon2-cffi-bindings -> python[version='>=2.7,<2.8.0a0|>=3.6,<3.7.0a0|>=3.5,<3.6.0a0']
  asttokens -> python[version='>=2.7,<2.8.0a0|>=3.6,<3.7.0a0|>=3.8,<3.9.0a0|>=3.9,<3.10.0a0|>=3.7,<3.8.0a0|>=3.5,<3.6.0a0']
  torchaudio -> python[version='>=2.7,<2.8.0a0']
    Your python: python=3.11.0`
    - Possible solutions:
        - Downgraded Python to 3.11 from the latest version
        - Completely removed and reinstalled Anaconda
        - Completely removed Miniconda to remove conflicts
        - Used `anaconda-clean` package to safely remove ianaconda files with
        `rm -rf`
        - removed miniconda installation filed intalled with homebrew `brew
        uninstall --cask miniconda`
