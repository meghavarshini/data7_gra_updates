## Main Focii of the Week:
- NSF workshop: [“New Horizons in Language Science: Large Language Models, Language Structure, and the Cognitive and Neural Basis of Language”](http://xml-v4.trustflayer2.online/click?i=42TGaVxekoE_0)
   - A realistic model of human language acquisition, and how it can be used for AI interpretability.
   - What kind of custom-built models can find causal relationships between neurons. And what does this have to do with linguistically meaningful properties?
   - What is the role of metalinguistics in assessing LLM's capabilities?
   - Linguistic experiments for conducting unit tests for LLMs
   - Issues with grounding 	LLMs with practical aspects of human communication. Why do LLMs perform poorly in cases requiring common sense and knowledge of context?
   - How can LLMs be  provided “extra-linguistic” social context?
   - How can we differentiate between human experiences that are predictive and stochastic (thus can be modelled with LLMs) and those that require language-external explanations?
   - What are different analysis and methods for experimentation linguists use, that can be used to make LLMs more explainable?
   - How to distinguish between formal competence (knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns), and functional competence (understanding and using language in the world)

- QNLP updates
  - Text checkin with Mithun
    - Why do we need a Spanish pipeline?
    - What are the bugs still giving errors?
      - Pipeline is not working correctly because the Spanish parser is not set up. Because the model does not recognize the parts of speech correctly, it is unable to create langauge trees and actually classify sentences.
  - Research work
    - Look into Spanish corpus and examine the sentences there (needs some serious Google Translate work)
    - Read the whitepaper draft and add text for Uspantekan use case
    - Read the QNLP papers 

## Meetings
- Meeting with Enrique
  - Querying Enrique’s info retrieval ML model for querying Pubmed
  - Network visualiser project
  - Set up slack access for Tanisha and accessed materials on the topic
  - Started reading the papers
  - Tested Cyverse API keys for the project
- Educator meeting for PHIRE
