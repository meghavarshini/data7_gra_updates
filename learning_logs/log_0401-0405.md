## Main Focii of the Week:
- QNLP research:
  - Lambeq- removed “glue” words, or ones that don’t add to the semantics of a sentence. these correspond to the stop words of a language
  - Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1krT2ibzrfLxin6VT5-nyXWr8_HGEHNVF?usp=sharing
  - research ansatz
    - Advantage- it is able to better capture the richness of meaning
  - Current status- spanish spacy tokenizer is able to tokenize correctly for Spanish. However, QBIT assignment is not working.
    - How do we initialise the qbits?
  - Pipeline for the task:
    - Use the same task as tutorial: https://cqcl.github.io/lambeq/tutorials/trainer-quantum.html
    - data- 100 spanish sentences from the uspantecan corpus
  - ToDo- plan a classification task for uspantecan
    - Robert Henderson’s repo: https://github.com/bkeej/usp_qnlp
    - We select 2 data files, with different topics
    - We create a classification task for differentiating between sentences under each topic
- Outreach: Met and interacted with a high-school student interested in Linguistics
  - Attended CogSci colloquium with her
  - Lab and campus tour
  - Arranged meetings with colloquium speaker and Lingusitics HoD

## Meetings
- QNLP Meeting 2-4pm
- Meeting with Brenda to discuss upcoming workshops 
  - Pytorch or Scikit learn
  - Plan for concepts
  - Autoencoders research
- Meeting with Shashank to discuss funding situation and summer research plans
